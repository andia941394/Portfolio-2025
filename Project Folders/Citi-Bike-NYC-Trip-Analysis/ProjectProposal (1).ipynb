    "# Project Overview: Analyzing Citibike Usage Data for July 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Objective\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to analyze Citibike usage data for July 2024. We aim to discover trends, understand user behavior, and provide data-driven insights that can inform management strategies for transportation in New York City. Our focus will be on understanding key aspects of user patterns such as ride frequency, trip durations, popular routes, and the differences between members and casual users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Plan\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "We will start by loading and preprocessing the Citibike data. This includes cleaning and formatting the data to ensure it is ready for analysis. We will make decisions that best fit the dataset to maximize its usefulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "We will conduct an exploratory data analysis to dive deeper into the dataset and uncover actionable insights. This phase will also help us identify any new questions that may need further investigation. Our specific areas of focus will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identifying Peak Usage Times**:\n",
    "  This will help with resource planning and ensure Citibike stations are properly equipped during busy times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mapping Popular Stations and Routes**:\n",
    "  This can highlight which areas need more attention or infrastructure improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparing Member and Casual User Behavior**:\n",
    "  Understanding differences between these groups can support targeted marketing efforts and service improvements. For example, we want to find out if casual riders prefer certain routes or times compared to members.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Electric vs. Standard Bike Usage**:\n",
    "  Analyzing which type of bike is preferred will help transportation planners make more informed decisions about future investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Resources\n",
    "For analysis and visualization, we will use:\n",
    "- **Pandas**: To manipulate and clean the data.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: To create charts and graphs that visualize our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "By completing this project, stakeholders such as city planners, transportation authorities, and Citibike itself will gain a better understanding of user needs. They will have clearer insights into peak usage times, high-traffic routes, and user demographics. This can drive strategic decisions that improve user satisfaction and operational efficiency.\n"
