### Introduction

The Masterâ€™s in Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University helped me build strong technical and problem-solving skills. In this portfolio, Iâ€™m sharing a group of projects I completed during the program that show how Iâ€™ve learned to work with data, create models, explain results, and think about the ethical impact of data work. Each project helped me grow and become more confident in using data to solve real-world problems.

**Project Title: Airbnb Fraud Detection**\
In **IST 707: Applied Machine Learning**, my teammates and I explored fraudulent listing patterns on Airbnb by applying clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and K-Means in Python. We cleaned and preprocessed listing data, identified anomalies through unsupervised methods, and visualized clustering results. We also considered how algorithmic bias could affect fraud detection and the fairness of such models. I contributed to the model development, data visualization, and ethical evaluation of our findings.\
***Learning Goal:*** Apply programming and machine learning tools to extract insights and evaluate predictive models ethically.\

**Project Title: Citi Bike NYC Trip Analysis**\
In **IST 652: Scripting for Data Analysis**, our team investigated patterns in NYC bike-sharing data in relation to weather, geography, and time. Using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, we integrated trip data with weather datasets to evaluate usage by hour, day, and borough. We found key insights into how public infrastructure supports mobility and identified potential inequities in access to services. My responsibilities included data merging, time-based visualizations, and writing summary scripts.\
***Learning Goal:*** Collect, store, and analyze data to generate actionable insight using scripting languages.\

**Project Title: eSC Energy Consumption**\
In **IST 687: Introduction to Data Science**, I worked with my team to analyze smart meter data from residential homes to uncover usage patterns and inform energy-saving strategies. We used R to explore and visualize daily and seasonal consumption trends. I was responsible for data wrangling, developing consumption forecasts, and presenting results through ggplot2 charts. The project emphasized data privacy concerns and the importance of designing ethically aware data practices.\
***Learning Goal:*** Use data science tools to perform exploratory analysis and communicate results responsibly.\

**Project Title: Event Management Database System**\
In **IST 659: Data Administration Concepts and Database Management**, our team designed a full-stack relational database system for managing event planning and participant registration. We defined the entity-relationship model, normalized tables, and implemented the schema using SQL. I focused on writing SQL queries for analytics, creating entity diagrams, and ensuring the database followed privacy and access control best practices. This project deepened my knowledge of database architecture and secure data design.\
***Learning Goal:*** Design and implement relational databases with attention to privacy, security, and organizational value.\

**Project Title: Data Science Salary Insights**\
In **IST 719: Information Visualization**, I independently analyzed global salary survey data to understand compensation trends across countries, job roles, and industries. I applied statistical techniques in R to clean the data and built comparative plots showing disparities in pay based on role, gender, and region. My project highlighted significant inequalities and offered visual tools for HR professionals and job seekers. I gained experience in translating data into visual stories that can support fairness in employment.\
***Learning Goal:*** Communicate data-driven insights using effective visualizations with consideration for ethics and fairness.\

---

**Project Title: Tableau Business Dashboard â€“ U.S. Storm Analysis**\
As part of a team project in **IST 718: Visual Analytics with Tableau**, we analyzed U.S. storm data to explore trends in frequency, impact, and location of major weather events. Using Excel and Tableau, we built an interactive dashboard showing storm types by year, geographic damage patterns, and fatalities. I contributed to data cleaning, dashboard design, and building filters and parameters to enhance usability. This project improved my skills in data visualization, collaboration, and communicating critical information clearly.\
***Learning Goal:*** Apply visual analytics tools to support data storytelling and stakeholder communication.\

### Conclusion

This portfolio brings together everything Iâ€™ve learned in the Applied Data Science program. The projects show how Iâ€™ve improved in working with data, solving real problems, using tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau, and thinking about the ethical side of data science. Iâ€™m ready to use these skills in future jobs and keep learning as the field continues to grow.
